## Data Collection
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, Reyes-Ortiz et al. captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

The features selected for this dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals (denoted with 'Acc' and 'Gyro' in the variable names as in 'tAcc_XYZ' and 'tGyro_XYZ'). These time domain signals (prefix 't' at the beginning of a variable name to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc_XYZ and tGravityAcc_XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (denoted by 'Jerk' in the variable names: 'tBodyAccJerk_XYZ' and 'tBodyGyroJerk_XYZ'). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (denoted by 'Mag' in the variable names: tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc_XYZ, fBodyAccJerk_XYZ, fBodyGyro_XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag (the 'f' at the beginning of a variable name indicates this frequency domain). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' in the variable names are used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
